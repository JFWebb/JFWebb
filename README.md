🔭 I’m currently a Senior GIS Full-Stack Engineer working at the intersection of geospatial data and modern web development.

🌐 My toolkit includes React, Python, Node.js, and ArcGIS — and I love building map-based interfaces that make complex data more accessible.

🧩 I'm interested in collaborating on projects involving location-based services, spatial analysis, and civic tech tools.

🛠️ Recent projects include modernizing citywide GIS applications, automating Salesforce integrations with Python, and developing data dashboards featured in the Boston Globe.

🌱 Always learning — currently diving deeper into open GIS libaries, testing strategies, and scalable backend systems.

💬 Let’s talk cartography, urban data, or spatial UX — I believe great maps start with great conversations.

🎨 Outside of code, I enjoy figure drawing, art museums, and foregin filns.
